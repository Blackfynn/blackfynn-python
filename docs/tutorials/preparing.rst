Preparing for the Tutorials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
   Before the tutorials, you will need to download the test files that
   can be found `here <http://data.blackfynn.io/tutorials/example_data.zip>`_

Once you download the files, make sure that you extract the contents of the compressed folder and place
the expanded folder in the same directory in which you will be running the tutorials. You should be able
to see the directory that contains the test files in your current working directory.

.. code-block:: console

   bf-user$ ls
   example_data/

Once you do this, you will be ready to start the tutorials.
